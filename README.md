Web Resistance
==============
A browser-based tribute to the popular logic and deduction game, **The Resistance**

It's a work in progress!

### Tell me more!
Sure thing buddy. **The Resistance*** is a game of intrigue and mystery, designed and web-published by Don Eskridge, and later published in a big shiny box with a bunch of expansions that [you should really check out](http://www.amazon.com/Indie-Boards-Cards-RES2IBC-Resistance/dp/B008A2BA8G/ref=pd_sim_t_1/176-2139082-0696027). In the game, players are secretly assigned to one of two teams - the Underground Resistance, or the Imperial Spies. The Resistance forms teams to send on missions, and the Spies secretly try to thwart the Resistance's attempts at victory through subterfuge and sabotage. Who among you is a Spy? Only the other Spies know for sure...
What you find here is a server to organize games of **The Resistance** through a browser-based client. The project is being developed by a small team of fans, as a part of our Software Engineering course at the New Mexico Institute of Mining & Technology (NMT). Feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns you may have.
